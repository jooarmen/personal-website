    <p>
         I hope to become the first software 
         developer in my family. My family has
         yet to have a single family member make 
         anywhere near a 100k salary, and I hope 
         to become the first. I understand it is a long 
         and difficult process but with a 
         positive mindset, I will achieve my goal in 
         the near future.
